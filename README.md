# CL-TRON-MCP

`cl-tron-mcp` is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Common Lisp development. It starts or connects to a live Swank session and lets an MCP client inspect objects, read debugger state, evaluate code, hot-reload fixes, invoke restarts, and keep working inside the same Lisp image.

## What Tron Is For

Tron is built around the Common Lisp workflow that matters most for agentic programming:

1. keep one Lisp session running,
2. hit an error,
3. inspect the stack and locals,
4. compile a fix without restarting,
5. continue or restart from the debugger.

Tron is tested to run under SBCL or ECL.

## Architecture in One Picture

```text
SBCL + Swank  <---->  Tron (MCP server)  <---->  MCP client / AI agent
your code              tools/resources            Codex, Cursor, Copilot, etc.
debugger state         approval flow
loaded systems         stdio or HTTP transport
```


## Quick Start

### 1. Install with Quicklisp

The easiest path is to clone the repo into Quicklisp local projects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alba-Intelligence/cl-tron-mcp.git ~/quicklisp/local-projects/cl-tron-mcp
cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects/cl-tron-mcp
```

If you keep the repo elsewhere, make sure Quicklisp can still see it by pushing the directory into `ql:*local-project-directories*` or by symlinking it into `~/quicklisp/local-projects/`.

### 2. Preload the System Once

This avoids the first-client-start timeout that can happen while SBCL compiles the project for the first time:

```bash
sbcl --non-interactive \
  --eval '(load (merge-pathnames "quicklisp/setup.lisp" (user-homedir-pathname)))' \
  --eval '(ql:quickload :cl-tron-mcp :silent t)'
```

### 3. Start Tron

The easiest way to start is from the repository root:

```bash
./start-mcp.sh                # long-running HTTP/combined mode 
./start-mcp.sh --stdio-only   # for stdio-based MCP clients
./start-mcp.sh --http-only    # for http-based MCP clients

./start-mcp.sh --use-sbcl   # choose your weapon of choice
./start-mcp.sh --use-ecl   

```

`start-mcp.sh` is the canonical runtime entrypoint. `run-mcp.sh` exists only as an optional convenience wrapper for `devenv` users.
For long-running modes, `Ctrl+C` is intercepted and stops the launcher cleanly; `./start-mcp.sh --stop` also shuts down a running instance.

### Local Codex Integration

Register Tron once for the Codex CLI, desktop app, and IDE extension:

```bash
./create_configs.sh --client codex
codex mcp get cl-tron-mcp
```

The Codex registration launches Tron over stdio with an independent target
Swank session on port 4006, Codex-native approval for mutating tools, and a
focused high-level tool profile. Restart Codex or open a new session after
installing; use `/mcp` in the TUI to inspect the connection. See
[`examples/codex-config.toml.example`](examples/codex-config.toml.example)
for the generated configuration shape.


### 4. Start a Swank Session

If no Swank server is running, one will be automatically started. Otherwise, one is already running, Tron will only start the MCP server.

In the Lisp image, you want the agent to work with:

```lisp
(ql:quickload :swank)
(swank:create-server :port 4006 :dont-close t)
```

### 5. Verify the MCP Starts

```bash
# Assuming that the MCP was actually started on port 4006
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4006/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

You should receive a JSON-RPC response that shows all available commands / tools.

### 6. Connect Tron to Swank

Once the MCP server is running, use either:

- `repl_connect` for the higher-level unified workflow, or
- `swank_connect` for lower-level Swank access.

Example tool call:

```json
{
  "name": "repl_connect",
  "arguments": { "port": 4006 }
}
```

## Tool Surface

The full registry exposes **90+ tools** across **14 categories**, including:

- debugger tools (`debugger_*`, `breakpoint_*`, `step_frame`)
- unified REPL tools (`repl_*`)
- raw Swank tools (`swank_*`)
- hot-reload tools (`code_compile_string`, `reload_system`)
- inspection, profiling, tracing, monitoring, logging, xref, security, and managed Swank-process tools

See [docs/tools/index.md](docs/tools/index.md) for the full per-tool reference and [docs/code-reference.md](docs/code-reference.md) for the source-level map.

## Recommended Workflow

For interactive debugging and hot reload:

1. start the target Lisp image with Swank,
2. start Tron,
3. connect with `repl_connect`,
4. use `repl_eval`, `repl_backtrace`, `repl_frame_locals`, `repl_get_restarts`, and `repl_compile`,
5. continue with `repl_continue` or invoke a restart.

If you need to launch a disposable SBCL session from Tron itself, use the managed-process tools:

- `swank_launch`
- `swank_process_list`
- `swank_process_status`
- `swank_kill`

## Optional Nix / devenv Support

The project still ships a `devenv.nix` for contributors who want a reproducible shell with SBCL, ECL, and helper tools preinstalled. That is now an **optional development environment**, not the primary installation story.

## Current Caveats

- The best-supported debugger workflow is **SBCL + Swank**.
- The local hot-reload fallback is useful when no REPL is connected, but the full debugger/restart workflow requires a live Swank session.
- Some features are implementation-specific; the docs call those out where relevant.

## Testing

Run the existing suite with:

```lisp
(asdf:test-system :cl-tron-mcp)
```

Or from the shell:

```bash
cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects/cl-tron-mcp
sbcl --non-interactive \
  --eval '(load (merge-pathnames "quicklisp/setup.lisp" (user-homedir-pathname)))' \
  --eval '(pushnew (truename ".") ql:*local-project-directories* :test (function equal))' \
  --eval '(asdf:test-system :cl-tron-mcp)'
```
